- New routed contract: `{"authority":"docs/decisions/0069-bounded-change-and-notes-history.md","control":"bounded_collection","lifecycle":"partitioned","member_limits":{"DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md":{"max_bytes":65536,"max_lines":512},"docs/history/development-notes/manifest.jsonl":{"max_bytes":16384,"max_lines":18}},"members":["DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md","docs/history/development-notes/*.md","docs/history/development-notes/manifest.jsonl"],"owner":"LIVE-DOCUMENT-PRESSURE-CONTAINMENT.3","route_targets":["DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md","docs/history/development-notes/*.md","docs/history/development-notes/manifest.jsonl"],"state":"current","transition_owners":null,"verifier":"document_history"}`

## Context

The mandatory `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md` rollover for `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.14.7.6.4` creates immutable segment
`4989` from exact clean activation commit `108003eeef6125674fecd3fa72d9c660915d6ef8`. Together with the bounded
current root, manifest, and seventeen immutable segments, the controlled collection contains nineteen files and
the manifest contains eighteen records. The rollover oracle passes, then the routing-pressure doctrine rejects
only 19 files versus 18 and 18 manifest lines versus 17.

The resulting collection remains below its aggregate ceilings at 24,041/27,000 lines and
2,574,480/3,145,728 bytes. Every immutable segment remains at or below 4,096 lines and 524,288 bytes; the current
root is 251/512 lines and 26,498/65,536 bytes; the new segment is 215 lines and 21,008 bytes; and the manifest is
18 lines and 10,722/16,384 bytes. Only the finite file-count and manifest-line controls were exceeded.

## Decision

Increase only `engineering_notes.limits.max_files` from 18 to 19 and the manifest member's `max_lines` from 17 to
18. Preserve the same owner, lifecycle, control, member patterns, every byte limit, per-history-file line limit,
aggregate ceilings, verifier, and ADR `0069` storage authority. This is one reviewed finite capacity step for one
content-addressed immutable segment and its manifest record, not a refreshed baseline or growth waiver.

## Consequences

- The required complete-record rollover stays durable, content-addressed, queryable, and reconstruction-safe.
- All root, byte, per-history-file, and aggregate pressure controls remain unchanged.
- Any next file-count or manifest-line increase again requires a newly staged and indexed exact-limit ADR.
- Parser, compiler, runtime, DSL, backend, public API, README, CLI, storage-root, and path behavior do not change.
