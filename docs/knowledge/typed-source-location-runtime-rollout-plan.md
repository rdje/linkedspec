status: runtime value/projection plan frozen; audited public-ledger correction pending before implementation

evidence: "FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.14.2.0 retrieved ADR 0056, the neutral contract/checker, adjacent live-ledger contracts, TOOLBOX.md, and exact runtime source/test authorities. Perl uses decoded-string scalar offsets; Rust and Lua use UTF-8 bytes; Dart and Julia use code units. Complete named-mark consumers pass on all six runtimes. The exact contract/checker still encode completed public owners .14.1.2-.3 as pending because both leaves explicitly excluded contract changes, leaving no promotion owner. ADR 0056 section 9 and the owning task freeze the correction and implementation order."

The canonical design remains ADR `0056`; the exact implementation plan and rollout correction live under
`FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.14.2.0-.14.2.7` in `docs/tasks/FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.md`.

One runtime-internal source authority owns decoded text by opaque input `source_id`. Immutable positions and spans
carry only that identity, Unicode-scalar offsets, and direct-span provenance; derived text carries an ordered span
sequence plus explicit `concatenate_in_order` policy. The authority validates and materializes. Values never embed
the text, a path, regex state, parser state, or a host reference.

Efficient host registers remain unchanged: Perl uses decoded-string scalar offsets, Rust and Lua use UTF-8 bytes,
and Dart and Julia use code units. Each backend converts at the typed boundary. Existing generated-spec artifact
identity is separate from input-source identity.

The 92 canonical source-boundary helpers and seven callable aliases project through typed values internally while
preserving their current strings, numbers, collections, absence values, and cursor/mark mutation behavior. No DSL
spelling, top-level typed facade, descriptor schema, semantic/MCP projection, parse-result shape, or span-native
dispatch is admitted by `.14.2`.

This slice owns only the four value diagnostics: source mismatch, position out of range, reversed span, and invalid
derived provenance. Later leaves retain mark-lifetime, transaction, recursion/progress, gap, and dispatch errors.

The rollout ledger is live admission state. It became stale because public owner `.14.1.2` explicitly excluded the
contract and no-change recomposition `.14.1.3` required it unchanged. Correction `.14.2.0.1` promotes those two
completed public rows and re-owners the five runtime rows to exact admission leaves `.14.2.1.3-.14.2.5.3` before
Perl implementation begins.
