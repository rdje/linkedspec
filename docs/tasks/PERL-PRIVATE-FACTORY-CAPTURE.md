# PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE: Actual factory and dependency emission capture

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE`
- Status: `pending` / implementation planned
- Roadmap lane: `.spec language evolution / producer-bound residual repair`
- Created: `2026-10-10`
- Last updated: `2026-10-10`
- Owner: LinkedSpec repo-local PNT
- Parent: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.3.3.0.7.2.2.0.3.1.1.1.2.1.3` in `docs/tasks/SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.md`
- Planning owner: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.3.3.0.7.2.2.0.3.1.1.1.2.1.3.0`

## Goal

Implement the selected private actual-callback registration and separate injected dependency capture protocol.
Keep public callback references, dependency/context maps, ordinary values, contexts, aliases, effects, error objects
and canonical family order intact. This linked implementation tree preserves every existing stable parent ID;
no existing task content or machine consumer moves.

## Scope and boundaries

The selected protocol and original opaque dependency diagnosis remain canonical in
`docs/checkpoints/SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.3.3.0.7.2.2.0.3.1.1.1.2.1.0-plan.json` and
`docs/knowledge/perl-private-input-authority-selection.md`. Detailed proposed owner/API boundaries are in
`docs/checkpoints/SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.3.3.0.7.2.2.0.3.1.1.1.2.1.3.0-plan.json`. Planning introduces no runtime measurement or new behavior.

Known callbacks come from actual built-in factory references in the current original-source/producer scope.
Opaque dependencies receive separate captures and cannot donate nested publications to an outer callback.
Private lexical thunks may retain and invoke the actual callback only while caller maps and public returned
callback fields stay exact. List and void calls retain native contexts under publication-disabled boundaries;
only scalar calls use the existing scalar-string packet capture. Trusted later output builders must explicitly
retain and compose child captures; ordinary values alone transfer no packet.

Typed/raw output construction, packet composition, original interval mapping, complete private Phase0 and
independent canonical admission stay with the original parent owners. The current replacement algorithm and
quoted-first example do not change here. Other repositories and all submodules remain read-only black boxes.

## Task Tree

- ID: `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Actual factory/dependency registration and invocation boundaries under the selected original-source protocol.
  Dependencies: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.3.3.0.7.2.2.0.3.1.1.1.2.1.3.0`
  Children: `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.1`, `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.2`, `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.3`, `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.4`, `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.5`, `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.6`.
  Acceptance: Individual bounded owners preserve current public behavior and pass source-bound focused proof. Return independent composition to the original owner; no separate parent admission is inferred.

- ID: `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.1`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Private registration/dependency boundary framework and native differential lifecycle/context/alias/error proof; no production factory or pipeline activation.
  Dependencies: `RUST-DEPENDENCY-WARNING-ZERO.8`
  Owned paths: `perl/LinkedSpec/ActionIR/SourceEmissions.pm`; focused fixture/proof/claim, relevant Knowledge/book and continuity. No unrelated producer or mapping changes.
  Planned tier: `focused`
  Planned focused proof: Actual/native callback and invocation identities; scalar/list/void context where applicable, aliases, once-only effects, exact return/error/fatal values, opaque nested delegation, scope restoration/release and unchanged public maps. Complete supplied direct consumers, effective semantic faults, retained instrument/input/channel identities, relevant book and ordinary doctrines.
  Planned canonical boundary: none for bounded private implementation without public/generated/mechanical change; reclassify before writes if scope crosses those boundaries. Complete private Phase0 and canonical replacement remain separately owned.
  Planned claim record: none: Planning only; declare the actual source-bound measurement record at activation before publishing results.
  Acceptance: Follow the retained owner plan; choose no authority by name, copied metadata or equal value. Preserve existing selected input grants and callback references. Split further before writes if actual code paths exceed a safe slice. Commit before activating the next owner.

- ID: `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Actual built-in contract lower registration plus separate injected dependency calls. Reuse the canonical input_slice opaque-delegation diagnosis; prove current factory behavior without changing public maps/callback fields.
  Dependencies: `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.1`
  Owned paths: `perl/LinkedSpec/ActionIR/Contracts.pm`; focused fixture/proof/claim, relevant Knowledge/book and continuity. No unrelated producer or mapping changes.

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.1` | `pending` | Private framework after completed projection repair RUST-DEPENDENCY-WARNING-ZERO.8, before any factory/pipeline activation. |
| 2 | `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.2` | `pending` | Depends on the preceding bounded owner. |
| 3 | `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.3` | `pending` | Depends on the preceding bounded owner. |
| 4 | `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.4` | `pending` | Depends on the preceding bounded owner. |
| 5 | `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.5` | `pending` | Depends on the preceding bounded owner. |
| 6 | `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.6` | `pending` | Depends on the preceding bounded owner. |

## Handoff

After `.6`, independently accept the composed factory/input identity seams under
`SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.3.3.0.7.2.2.0.3.1.1.1.2.1.4`. The original
`SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.3.3.0.7.2.2.0.3.1.1.1.2.5` owns complete guarded private
Phase0/consumer acceptance; mapped replacement and independent canonical admission remain separate.

## Decisions

- `2026-10-10`: Link new bounded implementation owners instead of expanding the existing monolith or migrating
  its IDs/consumers. Existing task collection and per-file rules remain unchanged.
- `2026-10-10`: Preserve native list/void contexts with isolated nonpublishing dependency calls; do not force
  them through the scalar-string packet protocol. Registration and publication remain separate authorities.
- `2026-10-10`: Public dependency maps and callback fields retain actual references. Any private lexical thunk
  must forward the retained actual callback and original argument aliases; otherwise instrument the call site.

## Blockers

Projection repair `RUST-DEPENDENCY-WARNING-ZERO.8` is complete. No factory implementation blocker is known.

Exact implementation details and any necessary finer function-family splits belong to the next owner
before its production writes. Artifact recovery/purge remains prohibited pending SESSION-STARTUP-READING.7.

## Verification Log

Planning/routing verification belongs to `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.3.3.0.7.2.2.0.3.1.1.1.2.1.3.0`; no implementation or runtime result is claimed here.

## Commit Log

The planning commit belongs to the original tree. Every implementation leaf records its own result and commit
beside its stable ID; Git is the commit-identity authority.

## Changelog

- `2026-10-10`: Created the linked bounded implementation tree under the existing private producer protocol.
