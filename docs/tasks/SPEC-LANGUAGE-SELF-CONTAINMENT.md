# SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT: Expressive `.spec` Closure and EBNF-Like Authoring Profile

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT`
- Status: `proposed` / director-approved direction; `.1+` awaiting future scheduling
- Roadmap lane: `.spec language evolution / expressive self-containment and alternate authoring profiles`
- Created: `2026-07-30`
- Last updated: `2026-07-30`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

Make `.spec` authoring expressively self-contained for LinkedSpec's problem domain: after source input enters the
engine, authors can describe grammar, natural recursion, cursor movement, captures, scoped state, callable
abstractions, composition, branching, iteration, transformation, and result construction without routine
backend-host escape hatches. Add an optional EBNF-like authoring profile that stays as close to familiar EBNF as
its semantics honestly allow while compiling losslessly into the same canonical LinkedSpec AST/HandlerIR/runtime
used by ordinary `.spec` syntax on every backend.

## Non-Goals

- Literal Turing-completeness as a marketing or acceptance claim.
- Arbitrary filesystem, process, network, environment, clock, randomness, package-loading, or host-FFI authority
  inside `.spec` files.
- A second runtime, second semantic model, backend-specific dialect, or EBNF-looking syntax with hidden magic.
- Replacing LinkedSpec's cursor/progressive-extraction identity with context-free grammar semantics.
- Weakening determinism, resource limits, structured diagnostics, source provenance, or five-backend lockstep.
- Implementing this long-horizon program ahead of already active backend-parity work without a clean, explicit
  scheduling decision.

## Architectural Invariants

1. **Problem-domain closure, not outside-world authority.** The language is self-contained for parsing,
   extraction, cursor/state control, transformation, and result construction. Host runtimes remain the substrate
   and input/result boundary; environmental effects require a separately governed capability design.
2. **One semantics.** Ordinary syntax and every authoring profile lower to one versioned canonical AST/HandlerIR
   contract and use the same validation, compiler, runtime, semantic-introspection, generated-source, and MCP
   projection paths.
3. **Lossless provenance.** Lowering preserves original source, profile identity, exact spans, canonical-node
   correspondence, and diagnostic remapping. Users debug what they authored, not synthetic canonical text.
4. **Honest EBNF resemblance.** A semantic-difference table explicitly separates ordinary EBNF production
   meaning from LinkedSpec seek/consume, ordered matching, cursor/state, captures, actions, and result semantics.
   LinkedSpec-only powers use visible extensions rather than overloading familiar EBNF punctuation deceptively.
5. **Five implementations, one contract.** Perl remains the reference oracle; Rust, Dart, Julia, and Lua consume
   the same neutral fixtures and contract. No backend or authoring profile advances alone.
6. **Evidence before syntax.** Real recursive/progressive formats and current shipped `.spec` constraints drive
   the capability inventory, grammar design, diagnostics, and performance envelope before frontend code lands.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A versioned neutral expressive-self-containment contract defines included language powers and forbidden ambient
  authority without claiming unrestricted computation or I/O.
- A governed capability/gap ledger proves whether normal objectives can be expressed using portable `.spec`
  grammar, recursion, cursor, capture, state, callable, control, transformation, and result primitives.
- The EBNF-like profile has a formal grammar, semantic-difference table, explicit LinkedSpec extensions, lossless
  source map, stable diagnostics, and one-way lowering into the canonical semantic model.
- Ordinary and EBNF-like forms prove canonical-node and runtime equivalence across representative recursive,
  cursor-sensitive, capture-heavy, stateful, and transformation-heavy fixtures.
- Perl, Rust, Dart, Julia, and Lua implement the same accepted contract; native, reconstructed, generated, semantic
  introspection, MCP projection, primary CLI, and mdBook claims remain aligned where applicable.
- Focused, mutation-sensitive neutral checkers and broader repository gates reject semantic forks, host escape
  dependencies, source-map loss, profile/backend drift, and misleading EBNF equivalence claims.
- Each executable leaf updates live docs/mdBook/Knowledge Map and commits through `COMMIT.md` before another leaf.

## Task Tree

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT`
  Status: `proposed` / director-approved direction; `.1+` awaiting future scheduling
  Goal: Deliver expressive problem-domain closure plus an optional lossless EBNF-like authoring profile on one
    portable semantic core.

  Status: `done`
  Goal: Ratify and durably route the director-approved architecture without changing language/runtime behavior.
  Acceptance: Record the problem-domain boundary, one-semantics/profile architecture, lossless-source requirement,
    five-backend obligations, detailed executable decomposition, roadmap/task/live/KM/book alignment, and explicit
    scheduling handoff; run documentation/doctrine gates and commit cleanly.
  Verification: Knowledge Map 762/6,186; mdBook 79 files / 13,884 KiB before exact cleanup; memory, whitespace,
    all seven doctrines, and canonical CI through both CLI environments plus Phase 0 1,031/1,031 in 641 seconds.
  Commit: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.0 - ratify expressive spec self-containment`

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Specify the neutral expressive-self-containment contract and capability vocabulary.
  Children: `.1.1`, `.1.2`, `.1.3`, `.1.4`
  Dependencies: `.0`

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.1`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Inventory current portable grammar/recursion/cursor/capture/state/callable/control/transformation/result
    powers and every routine host-language escape or expressiveness gap using LinkedSpec tools first.
  Acceptance: A source-located five-backend ledger separates implemented, partial, missing, compatibility-only,
    backend-host, and deliberately forbidden environmental authority.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Define the problem-domain closure boundary, determinism/resource model, state/scoping rules, and explicit
    environmental non-authority.
  Acceptance: Normative contracts answer what a `.spec` may compute, observe, mutate, return, and never access,
    including recursion/iteration limits, failure behavior, and host-boundary inputs/results.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Build neutral fixtures and a mutation-sensitive checker for representative self-contained objectives.
  Acceptance: Fixtures cover natural recursion, cursor algebra, interval/boundary capture, nested state, callable
    composition, branching/iteration, structural transformation, and typed result construction; mutations prove
    every claimed semantic dimension matters.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.4`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Close the contract/gap audit and split only evidence-backed missing primitives into separately ordered
    implementation leaves before any behavior change.
  Acceptance: Every gap has one owner, portable semantics, test oracle, backend order, compatibility policy, and
    documentation obligation; speculative general-purpose features remain excluded.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Formalize the single canonical syntax-independent semantic model and lowering contract.
  Children: `.2.1`, `.2.2`, `.2.3`
  Dependencies: `.1`

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.2.1`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Version canonical AST/HandlerIR nodes for grammar, cursor, capture, state, callable, control, transform, and
    result semantics with no source-profile or backend execution authority.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.2.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Define lossless authored-source provenance, profile identity, node correspondence, and diagnostic remapping
    through validation, compilation, serialization, generated source, semantic introspection, and MCP projection.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.2.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Govern one normalizer/validator/runtime path and reject semantic forks or profile-specific execution.
  Acceptance: Independent checkers reject duplicate semantic owners, backend/profile-only nodes, lossy source
    maps, noncanonical generated state, and diagnostics that point only at lowered synthetic text.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Close evidence-backed expressive gaps on ordinary `.spec` syntax before using an alternate profile to hide
    missing core semantics.
  Dependencies: `.1.4`, `.2`
  Acceptance: Each missing primitive is implemented Perl-first then Rust/Dart/Julia/Lua in lockstep, with neutral
    fixtures, generated/semantic/MCP projections where applicable, docs, and full gates; no host escape is added.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.4`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Specify the optional EBNF-like authoring profile as a transparent frontend to the canonical model.
  Children: `.4.1`, `.4.2`, `.4.3`, `.4.4`
  Dependencies: `.2`, sufficient `.3` closure for representative fixtures

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.4.1`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Publish the semantic-difference table between EBNF and LinkedSpec.
  Acceptance: Production choice/sequence/repetition/grouping/optionality/terminal/nonterminal semantics are
    compared explicitly with ordered search, seek/consume, recursion, cursor ownership, captures, state/actions,
    failure/backtracking, and result construction; every non-EBNF power remains visibly spelled.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.4.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Define the profile grammar and minimal explicit LinkedSpec extensions.
  Acceptance: Familiar EBNF notation is retained where semantics truly agree; cursor/capture/state/action/result
    constructs are composable, unambiguous, round-trippable, and never disguised as standard EBNF.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.4.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Define deterministic lowering, canonical equivalence, formatting, and source-map/diagnostic contracts.
  Acceptance: Equivalent ordinary/profile fixtures yield the same canonical semantic digest and runtime result;
    authored spans/messages survive invalid syntax, invalid semantics, recursion, and generated reconstruction.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.4.4`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Prove the proposed profile against at least three real recursive/progressive formats before implementation.
  Acceptance: Trials include nested recursion, deliberate cursor repositioning, nontrivial capture intervals, and
    typed transformation; awkward or misleading notation triggers redesign, not hidden compiler magic.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.5`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Implement the accepted EBNF-like frontend and lossless lowering in backend lockstep.
  Children: `.5.1`, `.5.2`, `.5.3`, `.5.4`, `.5.5`, `.5.6`
  Dependencies: `.4`

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.5.1`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Land the neutral profile contract, fixtures, semantic-digest oracle, source-map schema, and mutation checker.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.5.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Implement and admit the Perl reference frontend/lowering without a second evaluator.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.5.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Implement and admit Rust frontend/lowering parity.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.5.4`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Implement and admit Dart frontend/lowering parity.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.5.5`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Implement and admit Julia frontend/lowering parity.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.5.6`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Implement and admit Lua parity on PUC Lua and LuaJIT.

- ID: `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.6`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Close five-backend no-drift, public documentation, migration tooling, realistic examples, and operational
    signoff for expressive self-containment and the optional profile.
  Dependencies: `.3`, `.5`
  Acceptance: Ordinary syntax remains canonical and supported; profile adoption is optional and mechanically
    translatable; all backends/ABIs, generated roles, semantic/MCP projection, primary CLI, Knowledge Map, mdBook,
    doctrines, storage/relocation, and canonical gates agree; remaining gaps/risks are explicitly owned.

### `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.0` Acceptance Checklist

- [x] **CLEAN OWNERSHIP / RETRIEVAL FIRST** — Start from clean Rust-parent closeout `4aebf906`, create this task
  file before any other change, and retrieve the Knowledge Map plus ADRs `0006`, `0007`, `0035`, and `0056`.
- [x] **PRECISE SELF-CONTAINMENT BOUNDARY** — Define portable problem-domain closure across grammar, recursion,
  cursor/capture/state, callables, control, transformation, and results while rejecting unrestricted-computation
  marketing, routine host escape hatches, and implicit filesystem/process/network/environment/FFI authority.
- [x] **ONE-SEMANTICS EBNF-LIKE PROFILE** — Accept the alternate syntax only as an optional honest frontend with
  explicit semantic differences/extensions, one canonical AST/HandlerIR/runtime, lossless authored-source maps,
  author-facing diagnostics, and five-backend lockstep.
- [x] **DETAILED DURABLE DECOMPOSITION** — Split capability inventory, neutral contract/mutations, canonical model,
  evidence-backed core-gap closure, realistic profile trials, Perl/Rust/Dart/Julia/Lua rollout, and no-drift into
  separately verifiable leaves without scheduling implementation ahead of current callable parity.
- [x] **SIGNOFF / DOCS / COMMIT / CLEAN HANDOFF** — Align ADR/index/fact/task/roadmaps/live/architecture/mdBook,
  regenerate/check the Knowledge Map, render and exactly clean the book, pass memory/whitespace/doctrine and
  warranted canonical gates, commit `.0`, clear the brief, prove clean, and only then activate Dart `.11.5.1`.

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.0` | `done` | ADR `0064`, the complete decomposition, public/continuity alignment, and full documentation/canonical signoff durably route the direction without behavior change. |
| 2 | `SPEC-LANGUAGE-SELF-CONTAINMENT.1.1` | `pending` / awaiting future scheduling | Begin only after a clean explicit scheduling decision; current callable-codeblock backend parity remains next. |

## Decisions

- `2026-07-30`: The director approved expressive problem-domain self-containment: `.spec` authors should not feel
  limited when expressing LinkedSpec objectives, but this does not grant arbitrary outside-world interaction.
- `2026-07-30`: The director approved an EBNF-like alternative syntax in principle. It is accepted only as an
  optional, lossless authoring profile over the full LinkedSpec model—not literal EBNF, hidden magic, or a second
  semantics engine.
- `2026-07-30`: One versioned canonical AST/HandlerIR/runtime remains authoritative; all five backends implement
  one contract, and exact source mapping keeps profile diagnostics in authored coordinates.
- `2026-07-30`: Current callable-codeblock backend parity remains the immediate implementation program after this
  behavior-free routing leaf unless the director explicitly reprioritizes from a clean boundary.

## Open Questions

- Which three realistic formats best stress recursion, cursor repositioning, capture intervals, state, and
  transformation for `.4.4`? This is evidence collection, not a blocker for `.0`.
- Whether the profile eventually uses a header, extension, or explicit parser option is deliberately deferred to
  `.4.2`; selecting spelling during direction capture would be premature.

## Blockers

- None for `.0`.
- `.1+` is intentionally unscheduled behind the current callable-codeblock parity program until a later clean
  prioritization decision.

## Changelog

- `2026-07-30`: Created the task tree first from clean Rust closeout commit `4aebf906`; no other file changed
  before ownership existed.
- `2026-07-30`: ADR `0064`, the detailed program, Knowledge Map, roadmaps/live architecture, and mdBook align; full
  signoff passes without behavior change. `.0` is done and `.1+` remains unscheduled behind callable parity.
