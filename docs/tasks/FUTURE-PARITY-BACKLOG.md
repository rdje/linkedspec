# FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG: Future parity backlog and backend rollout

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG`
- Status: `active`
- Roadmap lane: `Overall roadmap - future parity backlog`
- Created: `2026-07-09`
- Last updated: `2026-07-09` (`.9.0` captured the director's corrected AND/OR edge-default model as parked
  future design work; no parser/runtime behavior changed).
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

Own the deferred backlog surfaced after the language-reference closeout, with the first lane
driving new backend implementations toward full parity with the Perl reference backend and the
Rust backend. Backend rollout order is fixed by director directive and ADR `0021`: Dart first,
then Julia, then Lua. The backlog also parks later architecture arcs that need design ownership
before implementation.

## Non-Goals

- Do not implement backend code in the tracking slice `.0`.
- Do not weaken the universal `.spec` contract or create per-backend dialects.
- Do not treat Perl plugin machinery as part of the backend-neutral contract.
- Do not normalize documented behavior caveats until their own leaves are activated.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The nine backlog directions are represented as owned task-tree lanes.
- The backend lane schedules Dart, Julia, and Lua in that order, all with full parity goals.
- Each backend implementation track owns a distinct LinkedSpec CLI entrypoint for that variant; no future
  variant should rely on a single ambiguous shared CLI name as its only user-facing command.
- The spec-derived parser/stimuli roundtrip idea is recorded as future design work, with `.spec` kept as the
  sole semantic source of truth for both parser construction and generated stimuli.
- The director's AND/OR edge-default correction is recorded as future design work: AND rules should default bare
  entries to blind-call sequence semantics, while OR rules should default bare entries to action-edge regex
  dispatch semantics.
- The central task-tree index points at the current frontier.
- ADR, roadmap, mdBook, Knowledge Map, and live docs no longer contradict the backend order or
  Lua adoption decision.
- Each completed leaf is committed through `COMMIT.md` with the leaf id in the subject.

## Task Tree

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: Own the future parity backlog after the closed language-reference/terse-format trees.
  Children: `.0`, `.1`, `.2`, `.3`, `.4`, `.5`, `.6`, `.7`, `.8`, `.9`

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.0`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: Create and register the future parity backlog tree.
  Acceptance: The task tree exists, the central index points at it, ADR `0021` records the
    backend rollout order, and roadmap/book/KM/live docs agree. No implementation code changes.
  Verification: **PASS 2026-07-09.** `git diff --check`, memory architecture, Knowledge Map,
    doctrine, task-tree metadata, mdBook build, and local CI pass; local CI includes phase0
    `1..1028`. No implementation code changed.
  Commit: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.0 - create future parity backlog`

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.1`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: Add future backend implementations in full parity with Perl5 and Rust.
  Children: `.1.1`, `.1.2`, `.1.3`
  Acceptance: Dart, Julia, and Lua each reach the same `.spec` language, helper/action AST,
    runtime semantics, staged parsing, diagnostics, and corpus parity contract as Perl5 and Rust.

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.1.1`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: Dart backend parity track - split/scaffold the Dart implementation path.
  Acceptance: Create or expand a dedicated Dart backend implementation plan before code, covering
    parser, helper/action AST, compiler/HandlerIR or interpreter strategy, runtime, regex engine,
    staged parser registry, corpus runner, docs, and parity gates against Perl5/Rust.
  Verification: **PASS 2026-07-09.** Created `docs/tasks/DART-BACKEND-PARITY.md` as the dedicated
    Dart backend plan. The plan covers parser/frontend, typed helper/action AST, interpreter-first
    compiled-state strategy, runtime, regex engine, staged parser registry, corpus runner, docs,
    trace/diagnostics, parity gates, and generated Dart source as a later proof lane. No backend code
    changed.
  Commit: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.1.1 - scope Dart backend parity plan`

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.1.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Julia backend parity track - split/scaffold after Dart reaches its scoped parity milestone.
  Acceptance: Create or expand a dedicated Julia backend implementation plan with the same full-parity
    obligations as Dart, reusing lessons from Dart without changing `.spec` semantics.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.1.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Lua backend parity track - split/scaffold after Julia reaches its scoped parity milestone.

  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Generalize staged linked parsing beyond the current function-body prototype.
  Acceptance: Public `parse_job(...)` authoring, import/provider search roots, multiple payload
    parser families, recursive staged queues, cycle diagnostics, docs, and corpus fixtures are
    split before implementation and kept implementation-language neutral.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Broaden Rust generated-source proof from curated subset to full manifest parity.
  Acceptance: The generated-source path either covers the full 99-fixture manifest or records
    narrowly owned blockers; interpreter parity remains the primary gate until this leaf closes.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.4`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Decide and implement user-function extension topics beyond the MVP.
  Acceptance: Recursive functions, closures/lambdas/currying, namespaces, alternate spellings,
    optional zero-arg parens, brace-less bodies, and caller-mutating forms are each accepted,
    rejected, or split with explicit `.spec` contract and parity obligations before code.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.5`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Normalize or permanently document helper caveats.
  Acceptance: Own the array split/pipeline return-shape caveats (`SPEC-LANG-REFERENCE.5.3.1`) and
    odd-arity `hash(...)` behavior (`SPEC-LANG-REFERENCE.5.4.1`) as explicit keep-or-normalize
    decisions, with Perl/Rust locks and mdBook/KM updates.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Decide the fate of Perl legacy plugin machinery.
  Acceptance: Scope whether `PPlugin`, `PluginBridge`, `PluginRegistry`, and deprecated facade stubs
    are retired, relocated, or retained as Perl-reference-only transition machinery; update tests,
    docs, and public API guidance accordingly.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.7`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Promote richer legacy/shipped-spec Rust oracle candidates safely.
  Acceptance: Triage richer `pplugin`, `tkgui`, `sdce`, recursive `tablegrep`, single-line `simenv`,
    VHDL port-clause, `ds_vhistory` branch, and placeholder `verilog` candidates; promote only
    JSON-safe, portable fixtures or split root-cause leaves.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.8`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: Explore spec-derived parser/stimuli closed-loop validation.
  Children: `.8.0`, `.8.1`
  Acceptance: The director's `foo.spec` idea is durable, design work is split before implementation, and any
    later prototype derives both the parser and the stimuli generator solely from the normalized `.spec` contract.
    No second hidden grammar or backend-specific fixture generator may become a competing source of truth.

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.8.0`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: Capture the director's single-source `foo.spec` parser/stimuli roundtrip idea.
  Acceptance: The task tree, index, roadmap/live docs, mdBook, resume pointer, and Knowledge Map record the future
    arc without changing active parser/runtime behavior or pivoting away from the Dart frontier.
  Verification: **PASS 2026-07-09.** `git diff --check`, memory architecture, Knowledge Map generation/check,
    task-tree metadata, doctrine, and mdBook build pass. No implementation code changed.
  Commit: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.8.0 - capture spec-derived roundtrip idea`

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.8.1`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Design the `.spec`-derived parser/stimuli roundtrip contract before code.
  Acceptance: Define the normalized grammar/semantic metadata needed to construct a parser and a stimuli generator
    from one `.spec`; specify bounded generation, termination/progress guards, expected-output oracles,
    shrink/minimize behavior, negative-case handling, staged parser composition, and cross-backend parity checks;
    explicitly reject any generator rule language that duplicates or drifts from `.spec`.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.9`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: Revisit AND/OR edge defaults and top-rule ceremony as future `.spec` language design.
  Children: `.9.0`, `.9.1`
  Acceptance: The director's correction to edge defaults is durable, design work is split before implementation,
    and any later implementation keeps Perl/Rust/Dart semantics aligned instead of silently changing one backend.

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.9.0`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: Capture the director's corrected AND/OR edge-default model.
  Acceptance: The task tree, index, roadmap/live docs, mdBook, resume pointer, and Knowledge Map record the future
    arc without changing parser/runtime behavior or pivoting away from the Dart frontier.
  Verification: **PASS 2026-07-09.** `git diff --check`, memory architecture, Knowledge Map generation/check,
    task-tree metadata, doctrine, and mdBook build pass. No implementation code changed.
  Commit: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.9.0 - capture AND OR edge default correction`

- ID: `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.9.1`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Design the corrected AND/OR edge-default contract before code.
  Acceptance: Specify grammar and runtime semantics for mode-sensitive bare edge lines. In AND rules (`:&`, `::&`,
    `:AND`, `::AND`, and bounded/repeated variants), a bare `entry { ... }` line should mean an explicit
    blind-call `=> entry { ... }`; in OR/default rules, a bare `entry { ... }` line should mean an explicit
    action-edge `-> entry { ... }`. Decide whether explicit `->` action-edges remain legal in AND rules, whether
    explicit `=>` blind-calls remain legal in OR rules, how this composes with `entry[k]`, fluent `.push` /
    `.return(...)` continuations, grouped/shared blocks, and diagnostics for ambiguous cases. Keep the boundary
    clear: blind-call means the parent does not preselect by the child rule's regex; the called child rule still
    owns its own parser/matching semantics unless this design explicitly creates a separate bypass. Treat
    first-rule-as-top instead of `::` and optional OR pipe sugar as separate decisions under this design leaf.

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.1.2` | `pending` | Julia follows Dart after `DART-BACKEND-PARITY` reaches its scoped milestone; PNT should select the active Dart tree first. |
| 2 | `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.1.3` | `pending` | Lua is now adopted as a future backend by ADR `0021`, scheduled after Julia. |
| 3 | `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.2` | `pending` | Staged parsing generalization follows unless the director explicitly pivots. |
| 4 | `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.3` | `pending` | Rust generated-source breadth is independent follow-up after backend scheduling. |
| 5 | `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.4` | `pending` | Function extensions need explicit language decisions before code. |
| 6 | `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.5` | `pending` | Helper caveats are documented but not normalized. |
| 7 | `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.6` | `pending` | Plugin machinery fate is a Perl-reference facade decision. |
| 8 | `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.7` | `pending` | Richer oracle candidates need safe fixture triage. |
| 9 | `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.8.1` | `pending` | Director's single-source parser/stimuli roundtrip arc is parked for later design; not a current Dart pivot. |
| 10 | `FUTURE-PARITY-BACKLOG.9.1` | `pending` | Director's corrected AND/OR edge-default arc is parked for later design; not a current Dart pivot. |

## Decisions

- `2026-07-09`: Director directive schedules future backend parity as Dart first, then Julia,
  then Lua, with the goal of full parity with Perl5 and Rust. ADR `0021` records the durable
  scope change and supersedes the earlier "Lua blocked pending decision" wording.
- `2026-07-09`: The tracking slice `.0` is documentation/task ownership only. No backend scaffold
  or runtime code is created until `.1.1` is selected and split.
- `2026-07-09`: `.1.1` selects an interpreter-first Dart parity strategy and delegates executable Dart
  work to `docs/tasks/DART-BACKEND-PARITY.md`. Generated Dart source is a later proof lane after
  interpreter/corpus parity, not the primary gate.
- `2026-07-09`: Director directive: each LinkedSpec backend variant should have a distinct CLI. Dart records
  this as `DART-BACKEND-PARITY.7.3` / `.7.4`; Julia and Lua planning leaves must include equivalent
  variant-specific CLI ownership when activated.
- `2026-07-09`: Director brainstorm captured: a future closed-loop validation arc should explore deriving both
  a parser for `foo` and a stimuli generator for that parser solely from `foo.spec`, making `.spec` the sole source
  of truth. This is parked under `.8.1` and is not a current pivot from Dart.
- `2026-07-09`: Director correction captured: future `.spec` design should swap the earlier optional-marker idea.
  AND rules should default bare entries to blind-call sequence semantics, while OR/default rules should default
  bare entries to action-edge regex dispatch semantics. This is parked under `.9.1` and is not a current pivot from
  Dart.

## Open Questions

- None blocking the active Dart tree. Julia `.1.2` is intentionally gated until
  `DART-BACKEND-PARITY` reaches its scoped milestone.

## Blockers

- None for `.1.1`.

## Changelog

- `2026-07-09`: Created the future parity backlog tree with seven initial owned lanes and Dart -> Julia -> Lua
  backend rollout order.
- `2026-07-09`: Scoped the Dart backend lane into `docs/tasks/DART-BACKEND-PARITY.md` and selected
  interpreter-first parity before generated Dart source.
- `2026-07-09`: Captured the director's single-source `foo.spec` parser/stimuli generator roundtrip idea as a
  low-priority future design lane.
- `2026-07-09`: Captured the director's corrected AND/OR edge-default model as a future design lane: AND defaults
  to blind-call sequence entries, OR/default rules default to action-edge regex-dispatch entries, and top-rule
  marker reduction plus OR pipe sugar are parked as related design questions.
