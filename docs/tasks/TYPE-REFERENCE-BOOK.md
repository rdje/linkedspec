# TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK: Complete navigable per-type language reference

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK`
- Status: `pending` / scheduled; no implementation pivot
- Roadmap lane: `.spec language documentation / complete type and method reference`
- Created: `2026-10-10`
- Last updated: `2026-10-10`
- Owner: LinkedSpec repo-local PNT
- Priority: P2 documentation completeness; P3 legacy status repair
- Intake owner: `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.3.1.3.2`
- Schedule: First documentation phase after the active private factory/callback implementation lane; before claiming the book supplies an exhaustive per-type reference.

## Goal

Give readers one clearly navigable canonical section for every supported value/type family, and a thorough,
example-rich entry for every currently supported operation. Inventory actual contracts and supported spellings
before deciding headings, moving text or asserting completeness. Keep the current private callback task selected.

## Verified intake and limits

The director's October10 DBIQNP question asks about scalar string/integer/real, array, hash and codeblock coverage.
The current SUMMARY links general DSL chapters. `value-container-flow-helper-reference.md` contains scalar
normalization, scalar predicates/string comparisons, numeric helpers/comparisons, array helpers, hash helpers and
array pipelines. Constructor, mutation, fluent and traversal material is distributed across other sections.
`values-containers-and-flow-helpers.md` contains detailed codeblock literal, parameter, invocation, return and
dynamic-context prose under Returning payloads, without a clearly navigable dedicated codeblock type section.
Several sampled operation entries are brief table rows with shared examples rather than complete individual
method entries. This is a qualitative organization/depth finding: no complete implementation-to-book inventory
or missing-method count has been established. Existing historical book closeouts do not certify this new criterion.

Three encountered legacy task files also contain explicit status contradictions. Their precise repair owner is
`.8` below; these do not block the current runtime task. Record descriptions, dated results and Git history must
be reconciled before changing any legacy completion field.

## Scope boundaries

Use current canonical contracts, public capability/backend limits and LinkedSpec-owned source/test interfaces.
RGX/PGEN and every other repository remain read-only black boxes. Distinguish constructors, literals, operators,
free helpers, receiver methods and codeblock invocation rather than inventing methods or new language types.
The director's integer/real terminology must be reconciled with actual scalar/numeric semantics, including any
boolean/null distinctions. A codeblock's yielded value selecting a receiver family is not evidence of a separate
codeblock dot-method family. Preserve current examples, anchors, includes and governed contracts when reorganizing.
Runtime defects discovered by the audit receive their own scheduled repair owners and are not hidden by prose.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A source/contract-bound inventory maps every supported operation and spelling to one canonical type section.
- String/scalar, integer/real numeric behavior, arrays, hashes and codeblocks each have direct navigation and a
  complete supported-operation reference, using the actual type model established by inventory.
- Each entry describes accepted signatures/arguments, result type/value, mutation/aliasing, empty/missing/error
  cases, chaining and callback behavior where applicable, supported backend limits and worked executable examples.
- Every inventory item is covered, cross-links resolve, former anchors remain usable, and complete rendered-book
  review confirms navigation and content. Declare actual measured proof records before publishing coverage counts.
- Ordinary leaves use focused proof; public contract or mechanical infrastructure movement requires canonical
  tier. Split repair families into further leaves before writes when needed; commit each accepted leaf via COMMIT.md.

## Task Tree

- ID: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Canonical per-type reference with complete current operation coverage and verified examples.
  Children: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.1`, `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.2`, `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.3`, `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.4`, `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.5`, `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.6`, `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.7`, `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.8`.
  Dependencies: `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.6`
  Acceptance: All inventory-backed reference and closeout leaves pass; legacy task contradictions are reconciled without refreshing historical claims.

- ID: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.1`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Inventory the actual supported type/operation surface and map current book coverage before edits.
  Acceptance: Reconcile canonical grammar/contracts/capabilities, owned receiver dispatch and tests; enumerate literals, constructors, operators, free helpers, receiver methods, aliases and codeblock invocation separately. Map every item to current and proposed canonical sections, identify exact depth/navigation gaps, retain executable example requirements and backend limits, and choose a bounded section/layout plan under existing document pressure controls. No exhaustive claim from sampled tables.
  Planned tier: `focused`; reclassify before any public/mechanical contract change.
  Claim verification: none: Unactivated qualitative plan; declare a source-bound claim record before publishing inventory or coverage measurements.

- ID: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Complete scalar/string reference and each supported associated operation.
  Dependencies: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.1`
  Acceptance: Add canonical navigation and per-operation signatures, arguments, conversions, results, empty/Unicode/missing/error cases, chaining/callback semantics and executable examples for every scalar/string inventory item. Preserve verified current behavior and existing anchors; split safely before implementation if needed.
  Planned tier: `focused`
  Claim verification: none: Future reference implementation; declare actual example/coverage proof at activation.

- ID: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Explain integer/real numeric behavior within the actual type model and every supported numeric operation.
  Dependencies: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.1`
  Acceptance: Resolve integer/real, scalar conversion, boolean/null and numeric validation distinctions from current contracts; document every inventoried constructor/operator/helper/method with results, precision/rounding/range/error boundaries where applicable and verified examples. State backend differences explicitly rather than inventing separate types.
  Planned tier: `focused`
  Claim verification: none: Future reference implementation; declare actual example/coverage proof at activation.

- ID: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.4`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Complete array reference across construction, access, mutation, pipelines and traversal.
  Dependencies: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.1`
  Acceptance: One navigable canonical array family covers every inventoried operation and alias, including updated independent mutation results, named receiver constraints, empty/non-array/error outcomes, order, chaining and callback behavior. Backfill individual worked examples rather than relying only on shared table examples; preserve existing pipeline and tree traversal contracts.
  Planned tier: `focused`
  Claim verification: none: Future reference implementation; declare actual example/coverage proof at activation.

- ID: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.5`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Complete hash reference across construction, lookup, mutation and traversal.
  Dependencies: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.1`
  Acceptance: Document every inventoried hash operation/alias with key/value arguments, missing-key behavior, returned values, order guarantees, mutation/aliasing and callable traversal semantics, supported forms/backend limits and individual verified examples. Preserve governed nested-write and map_leaves contracts.
  Planned tier: `focused`
  Claim verification: none: Future reference implementation; declare actual example/coverage proof at activation.

- ID: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.6`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Make codeblock values and all supported operations directly navigable and thoroughly documented.
  Dependencies: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.1`
  Acceptance: Canonical section covers literal/parameter forms, named and inline invocation, typed callback slots, result/return and dynamic-context behavior, mutation/composition and error cases established by inventory, with worked examples and exact backend limits. Distinguish invocation from receiver methods on a yielded typed value; list only actually supported codeblock operations.
  Planned tier: `focused`
  Claim verification: none: Future reference implementation; declare actual example/coverage proof at activation.

- ID: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.7`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Independently close complete per-type coverage and rendered navigation.
  Dependencies: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.2`, `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.3`, `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.4`, `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.5`, `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.6`
  Acceptance: Reconcile the entire retained inventory against canonical entries and runnable examples, verify old/new links and recursive includes, render and inspect all affected sections, and reject distinguishing omissions or stale semantics with retained controls before asserting exhaustive coverage. Update current book/status records and use canonical admission if the closeout moves public/mechanical contracts.
  Planned tier: Determine at activation from actual closeout scope.
  Claim verification: none: No coverage measurement yet; declare actual independent closeout proof before execution.

- ID: `TYPE-REFERENCE-BOOK.8`
  Status: `pending` / P3 continuity defect owned
  Goal: Reconcile the exact legacy documentation task-status contradictions encountered during intake.
  Reproduce: BOOK-DOCUMENTATION-SYNC metadata says done while its root node says active and all children/frontier are done. DOC-DRIFT-SYNC.2 says pending despite its dated Done verification and done frontier/tree-complete assertion. DOC-CODEBASE-ALIGNMENT.4/.5 say pending despite completed verification and done frontier/tree-complete assertion; several commit fields still say pending. BOOK-DOCUMENTATION-SYNC also has a four-cell Commit Log delimiter under a three-cell header, impairing table rendering.
  Impact: Contradictory task definitions can misdirect resumption or falsely reopen/close historical work; no runtime defect is inferred.
  Owned paths: `docs/tasks/BOOK-DOCUMENTATION-SYNC.md`, `docs/tasks/DOC-DRIFT-SYNC.md`, `docs/tasks/DOC-CODEBASE-ALIGNMENT.md`, exact related index/history projections and this owner.
  Schedule: Repair during the first documentation phase after the active private callback lane, alongside the reference inventory; not an active-task pivot.
  Acceptance: Audit only relevant Git subjects/diffs and dated verification records, reconcile root/leaf/frontier/commit metadata to actual accepted work, preserve every old result and historical claim, check current definitions and ordinary task/memory doctrines, and commit separately. Do not treat a stale pending field as proof that implementation is missing.
  Planned tier: `focused`
  Claim verification: none: Qualitative contradiction intake only; any new historical census or measured repair proof is declared before publication.

## Current Frontier

No active frontier: the private callback implementation remains selected in MEMORY.md.
After that lane, select `.1` for inventory and `.8` for the bounded legacy metadata repair, then the type-specific
leaves and independent closeout. Pending scheduling owns these findings through verified resolution.

## Decisions

- `2026-10-10`: DBIQNP authorizes discussion without pivot. Record and schedule the confirmed qualitative gap;
  do not claim unsupported missing-method counts or start reference restructuring during the current AST work.
- `2026-10-10`: Inventory actual language contracts before choosing the final type taxonomy or section layout.
  Historical book closeouts remain dated evidence; this tree owns the newly stated per-type completeness criterion.

## Open Questions

The inventory determines exact operation population, canonical section layout and any backend distinctions.
These are evidence questions owned by `.1`, not blockers requiring a director decision now.

## Blockers

None for queued planning. Execution waits for the scheduled clean handoff after the active callback lane.

## Verification Log

- `2026-10-10`: Intake reads current SUMMARY, value/container helper reference, Values/codeblock prose, fluent and
  declaration chapters, helper catalog and existing book task records. Structure and sampled entries establish a
  qualitative gap only. Exact legacy status contradictions are recorded above; no runtime or full coverage proof.

## Commit Log

Intake lands as continuity work in `PERL-PRIVATE-FACTORY-CAPTURE.3.1.3.2`; no future implementation leaf is complete.

## Changelog

- `2026-10-10`: Queue inventory, five type-family reference slices, independent coverage closeout and the exact
  encountered legacy metadata repair without changing the active private callback frontier.
