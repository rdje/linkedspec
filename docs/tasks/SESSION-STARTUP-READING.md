# SESSION-STARTUP-READING: Complete the Required Reading Before Implementation

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `SESSION-STARTUP-READING`
- Status: `active`
- Roadmap lane: `Session continuity prerequisite to RUST-MUTATION-TESTING.1`
- Created: `2026-09-06`
- Last updated: `2026-09-06`
- Owner: repo-local workflow
- Reading baseline: `baeb984e36a94a15951cd23d4c52def5064cdaca`

## Goal

Complete the director-required roadmap, first-party codebase, and mdBook reading with honest, recoverable
coverage, then resume `RUST-MUTATION-TESTING.1`. Reading supports signoff-quality execution; a saved reading
checkpoint is continuity work and is not feature completion, a code audit, or fresh runtime verification.

## Non-Goals

- Implement features, change behavior, run a mutation campaign, or adopt an unreviewed policy in this checkpoint.
- Count file enumeration, truncated output, historical test results, or unread material as completed reading.
- Include the `rgx` submodule or its nested dependencies in this startup reading pass.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All three required-reading answers become Yes only after their remaining material has actually been read.
- The exact baseline, exclusions, completed ranges, remaining work, and next action survive in committed state.
- Any discovered defect or policy gap receives an owning leaf and evidence before remediation.
- Roadmaps, live continuity, and task index agree; public book changes accompany material public understanding.
- Each completed reading/checkpoint leaf follows `COMMIT.md`; implementation remains gated until reading closes.

## Task Tree

- ID: `SESSION-STARTUP-READING`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: Complete the required reading and restore the implementation frontier.
  Children: `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.1`, `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.2`, `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.3`, `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.4`, `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.5`, `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.6`

- ID: `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.1`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: Commit the authorized startup-reading checkpoint before continuing the reading pass.
  Acceptance: Baseline and coverage are explicit, required-reading answers remain honest, and continuity points to `.2`.
  Verification tier: `focused`
  Focused checks: `bash scripts/check_memory_architecture.sh`; `bash scripts/check_doctrines.sh`; `perl tools/roll_document_history.pl --surface change_history --check`; `perl tools/roll_document_history.pl --surface engineering_notes --check`; `git diff --check`; staged-path and coverage review.
  Canonical trigger: `none` — bounded continuity documentation; no policy, infrastructure, or public contract changes.
  Verification: Activated task-tree-first from the clean reading baseline; memory, nine doctrine checks, both history-pressure checks, and diff/scope review pass. README routing was rerun after refreshing the staged snapshot; pre-commit checks the final candidate again.
  Commit: `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.1 - preserve required reading progress`

- ID: `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.2`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: Finish ROADMAP_V2.md from baseline line 1341 and reconcile its current direction with the completed ROADMAP.md reading.
  Acceptance: Baseline lines 1341–1585 are read without truncation; roadmap understanding and any real alignment issue are recorded.
  Verification tier: `focused`
  Focused checks: `bash scripts/check_memory_architecture.sh`; `bash scripts/check_doctrines.sh`; `bash knowledge-map/scripts/check_knowledge_map.sh`; `perl tools/roll_document_history.pl --surface change_history --check`; `perl tools/roll_document_history.pl --surface engineering_notes --check`; `git diff --check`; staged-scope and exact reading-range review.
  Canonical trigger: `none` — startup-reading continuity only; no public, policy, infrastructure, or runtime change.
  Verification: Baseline lines 1341–1585 read in five untruncated ranges; both roadmap diffs since baseline reviewed. Current direction agrees with the task index, mutation-testing tree, ADR 0039, and ADR 0073. Focused commit checks recorded below.
  Commit: `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.2 - complete roadmap reading`

- ID: `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.3`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Read and understand the remaining first-party codebase, including its tests, specs, and repository tooling.
  Acceptance: Split into bounded file/range children before execution; account for the baseline inventory and complete every in-scope child.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.4`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Read the complete mdBook and check its explanations against the roadmap and codebase.
  Acceptance: Split by SUMMARY.md chapters and bounded ranges before execution; read every chapter and own any verified drift.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.5`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Complete supplied-policy adoption/update comparisons and the startup alignment review before implementation.
  Acceptance: Record local adoption evidence and applicable donor updates; own any required changes; confirm all three reading answers Yes before restoring RUST-MUTATION-TESTING.1.
  Verification: `pending`
  Commit: `pending`

- ID: `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.6`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: Reconcile managed-run liveness reporting across restricted and permitted process inspection.
  Acceptance: Use one known live controlled run and compare same-run read-only `--list`, PID/group probes, and
    permitted process inspection; record exact mechanism and locations. Any confirmed false-dead cleanup boundary
    receives a repair leaf and a non-destructive regression plan before recovery is used. No ambiguous deletion.
  Verification: A restricted `--list` labeled the running doctrine marker abandoned; subsequent permitted `ps`
    still found wrapper 83739 and child/group 85961. Later probes found both gone and the successful run cleaned
    itself. The snapshots were not simultaneous, so this is a discrepancy requiring proof, not a proven deletion.
  Commit: `pending`

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.3` | `pending` | Inventory and split the remaining first-party codebase reading before executing bounded children. |

## Reading Ledger

All line ranges below refer to the **reading baseline**, not later shifted working-file line numbers. Files
modified by this checkpoint must also be reviewed in the final diff. Unlisted source files and unlisted ranges
remain unread; running a command that prints a file does not establish comprehension if its output was truncated.

| Required surface | Fully read and understood? | Completed at checkpoint | Remaining |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roadmap | **Yes** | `ROADMAP.md` 1–2564; `ROADMAP_V2.md` 1–1585. `.2` read 1341–1380, 1381–1420, 1421–1470, 1471–1530, and 1531–1585 without truncation and reviewed both current roadmap diffs. | Review later changes as they land; codebase/book alignment remains gated on their reading. |
| Codebase | **No** | `perl/LinkedSpec.pm` in full; checkpoint-relevant scripts listed below. | Its owner/import tree and all other first-party implementation, tests, specs, fixtures, and tooling not explicitly listed as read. |
| mdBook | **No** | `docs/linkedspec-book/src/SUMMARY.md`; `docs/linkedspec-book/src/development/local-ci-and-regression.md` 1897–1943 and 1988–2004. | All other chapter text, including the unread portions of that development chapter. |

The exact tracked file population and object identities are recoverable without an independently maintained
manifest or an absolute checkout path:

```bash
git ls-tree -r --full-tree baeb984e36a94a15951cd23d4c52def5064cdaca
git ls-tree -r --name-only baeb984e36a94a15951cd23d4c52def5064cdaca -- docs/linkedspec-book/src
git show baeb984e36a94a15951cd23d4c52def5064cdaca:ROADMAP_V2.md | sed -n '1341,1400p'
```

The recursive tree command does not descend into the `rgx` gitlink. During `.3`, classify the whole first-party
inventory, including files outside the obvious language directories; a language-directory census alone is not
complete codebase coverage. Generated source and fixtures are not silently excluded by a file-extension filter.
After a later commit, use `git diff --name-only` against this baseline to identify changed reading inputs; review
the changed portions as well as remaining baseline text. Immutable historical task parts use their indexed
retrieval contract rather than an indiscriminate chronology scan.

### Bootstrap and focused supporting material already read

- `README.md`, `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `SESSION_BOOTSTRAP.md`, `COMMIT.md`, and local `README_POLICY.md`.
- The supplied `AGENTS.md` instructions and `docs/TASK_TREE_README.md` in full; task-index purpose, active-frontier
  context, and operating rules at `docs/TASK_TREE.md` 3269–3525. The large embedded historical marker section has
  not been read in full.
- `docs/tasks/TEMPLATE.md`, `docs/tasks/RUST-MUTATION-TESTING.md`, and `docs/decisions/0039-rust-mutation-testing-cadence.md`.
- Knowledge cards `rust-mutation-testing-policy`, `bounded-live-document-store-contract`, and
  `verification-cadence-policy` in `docs/knowledge/`. Knowledge Map searches are retrieval, not a full-map read.
- `.githooks/pre-commit`, `.githooks/post-commit`, `.githooks/commit-msg`, `scripts/check_memory_architecture.sh`,
  `scripts/check_verification_cadence.sh`, `scripts/check_task_tree_metadata.sh`,
  `scripts/check_doctrines.sh`, `scripts/check_diagnosis_evidence.sh`, and `tools/check_memory_handoff_state.py`.
- Current `LIVE_ACHIEVEMENT_STATUS.md` in full; `CHANGES.md` and `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md` baseline lines 1–100.
  Their older chronology is not fully read; use the indexed history query when historical evidence is needed.
- The director-supplied fsmgen README policy, pgen claim-verification policy, and fsmgen live-document containment
  adoption guide were read in full through explicitly authorized read-only access. Their local adoption/update
  comparisons remain `.5`; reading a donor document does not establish local compliance.
- `TOOLBOX.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_STATE.md`, remaining owner modules, and the full book have not been read in full.
- `.2` additionally read `TOOLBOX.md` 1–125, 605–682, and 1703–1792; `tools/project_data_env.sh` 1–100;
  `tools/project_data_run.sh` 1–190; ADRs `0001`/`0073`; and knowledge card `project-data-descendant-liveness-gap`.

### Roadmap reconciliation at `.2`

- Activation: clean `a5d5dcd2955aaaa41166bd87de6bdc39a4502bc4`; `.githooks` is configured and no background job remained.
- Both roadmaps changed since the reading baseline only by the same four-line startup-prerequisite pointer.
  Those additions were read, and this checkpoint's final diff is part of review.
- The final roadmap sections explain compiler-state/error ownership, completed helper/control-flow migration,
  deferred frontend/validation work, and label-driven rule execution. Dated earlier migration spellings are
  historical evidence, not authority to restore retired helpers or restart closed work.
- Current direction remains startup reading, then `RUST-MUTATION-TESTING.1` under backlog `.20`. Its configuration
  precedes the separately owned pilot. ADR `0039` forbids per-commit mutation execution; ADR `0073` selects focused
  ordinary proof and canonical designated/push proof. No competing executable roadmap direction was found.
- No runtime behavior was verified by reading. No new public explanation is warranted by this checkpoint;
  substantive codebase/book drift, if found during `.3`/`.4`, must receive an owning leaf before remediation.
- Current batch count: one completed reading leaf in this resumed default-100 batch once `.2` lands; `.1` belongs
  to the prior checkpoint. No push is authorized by this intermediate boundary alone.

## Decisions

- `2026-09-06`: The director explicitly excluded `rgx` from this reading pass; the exclusion includes its nested
  dependencies and does not remove first-party Rust code or tests from scope.
- `2026-09-06`: After being asked to choose between a reading checkpoint and keeping every file unchanged, the
  director authorized proceeding and delegated the choice. This permits the narrow startup-tracking commit
  before full reading, resolving the session's no-document-edits prerequisite for startup tracking only.
  Implementation and unrelated documentation changes remain gated.
- `2026-09-06`: Keep detailed progress here and a short pointer in layer A; preserve the existing implementation
  destination. The checkpoint does not alter repository doctrine or make reading a substitute for production work.

## Open Questions

- None requiring director input. Remaining policy comparisons, reading decomposition, and the `.6` liveness
  discrepancy are owned work. Complete `.6` before any cleanup recovery; implementation remains reading-gated.

## Blockers

- None. At activation, Git was clean and no background job was pending. Required reading is unfinished work,
  not a test failure or an external blocker.

## Verification Log

| Date | Leaf | Checks | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `2026-09-06` | `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.1` | Exact HEAD, empty activation Git status, `.githooks` configured, scoped read coverage | PASS; all remaining reading stays explicit. |
| `2026-09-06` | `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.1` | Memory architecture, doctrine driver, history pressure, diff/scope review | Memory and both history limits PASS; eight doctrines PASS initially. README routing rejected two review edits absent from the staged snapshot. |
| `2026-09-06` | `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.1` | Restage reviewed files; `bash scripts/check_readme_stability.sh` | PASS: 20 surfaces, 62 routes, 32/32 mutations; all nine doctrine checks now pass. Final exact-candidate proof also runs in pre-commit. |
| `2026-09-06` | `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.2` | Untruncated ranges, baseline diffs, current direction, staged scope | PASS; roadmap Yes, codebase/book No. |
| `2026-09-06` | `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.2` | Memory, nine doctrines, Knowledge Map, both history-pressure checks, staged diff | PASS; all nine doctrines complete successfully, both histories below rollover, no trailing-space errors. Final evidence edits are checked again by pre-commit. |

## Commit Log

| Leaf | Commit subject or reference | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.1` | `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.1 - preserve required reading progress` | Startup-tracking-only exception; reading remains incomplete. |
| `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.2` | `SESSION-STARTUP-READING.2 - complete roadmap reading` | Completed roadmap reading; exact coverage and focused checks, remaining reading and liveness discrepancy owned. |

## Changelog

- `2026-09-06`: Created the owning leaf before any checkpoint edits; recorded baseline coverage and the remaining reading sequence.
- `2026-09-06`: Completed the focused checkpoint and synchronized continuity; remaining reading starts at `.2`.
- `2026-09-06`: `.2` completes the remaining roadmap ranges and current-direction reconciliation; codebase and
  mdBook reading remain No, and `.3` owns the next inventory/decomposition.
